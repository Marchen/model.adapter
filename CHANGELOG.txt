	- get.family() function use default value of family when family was not specified.
	- Add support of handling default family in call.
	- Add model.type field which contains type of models (regression/classification).
	- Improved predict() method of model.adapter/model.interface.
	- Several other improvement.
	- Bug fixes:
		- couldn't retrieve formula from ranger object.
		- because MCMCglmm object has 'multinomial' family when 'categorical' is specified, now 'categorical' family is converted to 'multinomial'.
		- model.interface.glmmadmb$get.family() returns "binom" instead of "binomial".
		- bug in init.data()
		- bugs related with environment.
		- model.interface.glmmadmb$predict did not handle glmmadmb with gamma distribution correctly.
		- model.interface.glmmadmb$predict method failed when handling model with random effect.
		- result of model.adapter$x.names() has random effect.
		- cannot use invalid call (i.e., calls can't produce model object) for model.adapter.
		- cannot install environments without testthat package.

	- Add predict.types() method which returns conversion table of common
	  types for predict method of model.adapter to function specific types
	  of predict.
	- Add support for glmmadmb.
	- Add residuals() method which fetch residuals of the model.
	- (Tentative) Add fixed() and intercept() method which fetch estimated
	  slope and intercept.
	- Reconstruct test suites.
	- Improved predict() method of model.interface classes.
	- Bug fixes.

	- Added support for result of MASS::stepAIC.
2016-12-31: 0.0.3
	- Fixed a bug: get.link() and get.linkinv() methods of model.interface.glm
	  class did not work correctly.
2016-07-11: 0.0.2
	- Changed the possible value of 'type' field of ma.prediction class.
	- Added predict(), get.link(), get.linkinv() method to model.interface.MCMCglmm.
	- Fixed a bug that get.family function does not work correctly when link function
	  is manually specified.
